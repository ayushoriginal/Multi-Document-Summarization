      <S SNO='8' PAR='8' RSNT='1'>The weather was clear at the time of the crash.</S>
      <S SNO='9' PAR='9' RSNT='1'>The crash happened during rush hour, as office workers were ending their day, so few people were in the building when it happened.</S>
      <S SNO='10' PAR='10' RSNT='1'>The building has since been cleared, and the fire is now under control, reported ABCNEWS' Rome bureau.</S>
      <S SNO='11' PAR='11' RSNT='1'>It damaged the 23rd through the 29th floors, which were being restored and weren't occupied at the time, local reports said.</S>

      <S SNO='14' PAR='14' RSNT='1'>A small tourist plane crashed into the tallest building in Milan.</S>
      <S SNO='15' PAR='15' RSNT='1'>(ABCNEWS.com/Magellan Geographix) The plane was destined for Italy's capital Rome, and departed from Lucerne airport in Switzerland, sources from the National Air Safety board told ANSA.</S>
      <S SNO='16' PAR='16' RSNT='1'>It was the second time since the Sept. 11 terror attacks that a plane has struck a high-rise building, and the crash raised fears of another attack.</S>

      <S SNO='23' PAR='23' RSNT='1'>According to ABCNEWS aviation expert John Nance, Piper planes have no history of mechanical troubles or other problems that would lead a pilot to lose control.</S>
      <S SNO='24' PAR='24' RSNT='1'>'Those aircraft have direct mechanical controls," says Nance.</S>
      <S SNO='25' PAR='25' RSNT='1'>"If you have a control problem, it would be the loss of an engine, and those are either controllable or not."</S>
      <S SNO='26' PAR='26' RSNT='1'>U.S. officials told ABCNEWS they had no indication the crash was a terrorist attack.</S>
      <S SNO='27' PAR='27' RSNT='1'>Neither American nor Italian forces were on heightened alert, they said.</S>
      <S SNO='28' PAR='28' RSNT='1'>The FBI has offered help in the crash investigation, but it remains to be seen if Italy will accept.</S>

      <S SNO='31' PAR='31' RSNT='1'>This is a breaking story and we don't have anything else beyond that   8212; the president has been informed."</S>
      <S SNO='32' PAR='32' RSNT='1'>"I think you can presume that we will be   8212; if we are not already   8212; in touch with Italian authorities and will ascertain precisely what the facts are," he said.</S>
      <S SNO='33' PAR='33' RSNT='1'>Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was on his way back to Italy from Bulgaria, and a crisis center is being set up.</S>

      <S SNO='35' PAR='35' RSNT='1'>On Jan. 5, a 15-year-old boy crashed a stolen plane into a building in Tampa, Fla.</S>

      <S SNO='42' PAR='42' RSNT='1'>Nevertheless, with its location near the city's central train station and its height relative to the buildings around it, the Pirelli building is considered a landmark and symbol of the commercial city of Milan.</S>
