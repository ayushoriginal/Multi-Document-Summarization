The Turkish government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz fell after mob-tie allegations .
Turkey 's constitution mandates a secular republic despite its Muslim majority .
Military and secular leaders pressured President Demirel to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party on the fringe .
Business leaders feared Virtue would alienate the EU .
Virtue 's leader ceded its right as Parliament 's largest party to lead the government .
Bulent Ecevit , leader of the Democratic Left Party and former PM , asked Yilmaz and True Path Party head Tansu Ciller to join him in a secular coalition , creating a large Parliamentary majority .
A political vacuum risked Islamic ascension
and endangered a Kurdish rebel 's extradition .
Demirel was expected to name Ecevit PM .
