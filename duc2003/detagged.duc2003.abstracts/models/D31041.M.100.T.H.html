Starting in May 1998 , Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) laid off 5000 of its 13,000 workers .
A 3-week pilots ' strike in June and a currency crisis that reduced passenger numbers made payments on PAL 's $ 2 billion debt impossible .
President Estrada brokered an agreement
to suspend collective bargaining for 10 years in exchange for 20 % of PAL stock and union seats on its board .
The large ground crew union initially voted no. After PAL shut down operations for 13 days starting Sept. 23rd ,
leaving much of the country without air service and foreign carriers flying some domestic routes ,
61 % voted yes .
Unions agreed to some employee cuts with separation benefits .
