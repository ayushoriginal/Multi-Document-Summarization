The United Nations Security Council established a War Crimes Tribunal in 1993 to investigate and prosecute crimes
arising from the breakup of Yugoslavia .
In October 1998 , the tribunal secured its third conviction
when a Bosnian Serb plead guilty to 13 murders .
Also that month , the trial of four for 1992 atrocities in a Bosnian prison camp was nearing completion .
Also , Kosovo became an area of contention .
The Yugoslavian government was claiming the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the 9-month rebellion
and was refusing investigators visas .
The U.N. tribunal sought to enter the province
and investigate atrocities reported by both sides .
