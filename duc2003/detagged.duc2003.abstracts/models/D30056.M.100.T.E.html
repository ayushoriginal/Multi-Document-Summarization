Four employees of Grange Telecom , a British telecommunications company , were found murdered following a failed rescue attempt by Chechen authorities .
The men had been decapitated .
The men , Britons Peter Kennedy , Darren Hickey , and Rudolf Petschi , and New Zealander Stanley Shaw , were abducted during a shootout in October
which also resulted in the wounding of several bodyguards .
The men were in Chechnya
working on installing telecommunications equipment for the Chechen government .
Despite warnings from the British government about the dangers of traveling in Chechnya ,
the company felt the risk to its workers was low
because the men were working for the Chechen government .
