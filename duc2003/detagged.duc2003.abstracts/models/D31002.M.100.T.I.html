Pope John Paul II paid a three-day visit to Croatia in November 1998 .
The primary purpose of this , his second , visit was the beatification ( the last step before sainthood ) of Cardinal Stepinac ,
who died in 1960 .
The Pope declared Stepinac a martyr to the atrocities of Communism ,
but many non-Catholics considered him a nazi sympathizer during World War II.
Almost 500,000 people attended the ceremony in Marija Bistrica .
The Pope later met with President Tudjman in Zagreb
and said a final mass in Split ,
where he called for reconciliation , a renewal of values ,
and increased international aid to the war-torn Balkans .
