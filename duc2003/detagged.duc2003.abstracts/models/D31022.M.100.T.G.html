A fire in a Swedish dance hall caused the death of 62 teenage Halloween revelers
and injured over 160 , some 17 of them seriously .
Although it was speculated that the fire was caused by arson , investigators have not yet determined the cause .
The hall was packed beyond its capacity of 150 with somewhere between 250 and 400 persons ,
and an exit stairway was blocked by fire .
Identifying the casualties was a wrackingly slow process due to severity of the burns and lack of identification cards .
The crowd consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents from at least 19 nationalities .
