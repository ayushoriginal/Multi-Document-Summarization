At fiscal year 's end on Sept. 30 , 1998 , Congress had not approved 13 necessary spending bills ,
so voted emergency funding to keep the government running through Oct. 9th , then Oct. 12th .
Members were eager to campaign at home for re-election
but also to ensure funding for pet projects .
Some bills risked veto because of anti-environmental riders .
Several bills combined into an omnibus bill would make veto difficult .
Republicans , vowing to avoid another shutdown that would distract attention from impeachment ,
became willing to resolve spending issues
and dropped huge tax cut demands .
Final unresolved issues included funding for the IMF and emergencies , and census technique .
Clinton consulted other governments on proposed IMF changes .
