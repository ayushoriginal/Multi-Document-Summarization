The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ,
headed by Bishop Desmond Tutu ,
has issued its report on human rights violations in South Africa during apartheid .
The report , which covers the years from 1960 to 1994 ,
lays a major portion of the blame on the ruling South African government during the period .
All political parties , especially the African National Congress , also were accused of involvement in human rights violations .
Former President de Klerk ,
who began the process to end apartheid in South Africa ,
was successful in having his name suppressed in the report .
The African National Council also was considering bringing suit
to have details of its role suppressed .
