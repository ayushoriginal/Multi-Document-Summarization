Syria acceded to Turkish demands
that it stop supporting the rebellious PKK
and expel the group 's leader , Abdullah Ocalan , averting a military crisis .
Turkey calls the PKK , which seeks an autonomous Kurdish state in Turkey , a terrorist organization and Ocalan the country 's most wanted criminal .
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict .
Ocalan , the subject of a Turkish international arrest warrant , was detained in Rome after arriving there from Moscow
where he had sought asylum .
It is uncertain whether Italy will agree to Turkey 's extradition request .
Meanwhile , hunger strikes to protest Ocalan 's detainment have occurred in Nicosia and Armenia .
