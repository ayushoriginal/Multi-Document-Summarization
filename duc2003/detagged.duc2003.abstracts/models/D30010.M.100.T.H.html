Friday morning shoppers fled the Mahane Yehuda marketplace when a smoking car approached the entrance .
It exploded , killing the bombers and injuring 24 ,
before explosives-filled suitcases could be carried into the crowd .
Hamas claimed responsibility
but Iranian-sponsored Islamic Jihad was later suspected .
Israel 's Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the US-brokered Wye Accord ,
under which Israel would relinquish 13 percent more of the West Bank and Arafat would crack down on terrorists .
Many doubted Netanyahu would let the accord be implemented ,
thus playing into militants ' hands .
Arafat and Clinton urged that the attack not derail the accord .
This third failure of an attempted attack suggested the crackdown on terrorists had produced results .
