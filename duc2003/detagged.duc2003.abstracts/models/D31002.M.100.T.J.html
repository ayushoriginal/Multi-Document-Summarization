Pope John Paul II , during a visit to Croatia , beatified the WW II cardinal of Zagreb , Alojzije Stepinac , for his staunch opposition to communism .
Though a hero to Catholics ,
who comprise 80 percent of Croatia , Serbs view Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi dictatorship
that governed Croatia and killed thousands of Serbs , Jews , and Gypsies .
Stepinac eventually denounced the atrocities ,
but to Serbs he is a symbol of Vatican cooperation with fascist leaders
who are now being recast as Croatian patriots .
Arrested in 1946 as a Nazi sympathizer ,
he was jailed
and then released under house arrest in 1951 .
