Two Libyans
were indicted in 1991 for blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie , Scotland in 1988 .
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992
because of their refusal to surrender the suspects .
The sanctions included a ban on all international flights .
After six years of sanctions , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , faced with threats of additional sanctions ,
agreed in principle to hand over the suspects .
The two suspects would be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law .
Gadhafi wants guarantees ,
including a promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted .
