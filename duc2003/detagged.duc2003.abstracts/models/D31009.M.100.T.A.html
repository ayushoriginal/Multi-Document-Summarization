In late 1998 the centrist government of Turkey led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed in a corruption scandal .
President Demirel approached Recai Kutan , leader of a pro-Islamic party with the most seats in parliament , to lead a new government .
Kutan demurred from even being part of the new government .
Next Demirel talked with Yilmaz rival , Tansu Ciller , leader of a center-right party tainted by the same corruption charges .
Ciller endorsed a broad-based coalition .
Bulent Ecevit , leader of a left-center party , then declared for a coalition with Yilmaz and Ciller .
Demirel scheduled a meeting with Ecevit ,
suggesting that Ecevit might be the next Prime Minister .
