Two Libyans , accused by the United States and Britain of bombing a New York bound Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland in 1988 ,
killing 270 people , 
for 10 years were harbored by Libya
who claimed the suspects could not get a fair trail in America or Britain .
The U.N. imposed international air travel sanctions on Libya
to force their extradition .
The sanctions were honored by all but certain African countries .
In 1998 , a U.S.-Britain brokered compromise offered
that their trial to be held in the Netherlands .
Gadhafi , tired of sanctions
and hoping for increased tourism ,
actively pursued this compromise with UN Chief Kofi Annan .
