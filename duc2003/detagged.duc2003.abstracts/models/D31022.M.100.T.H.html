Sweden 's deadliest fire in decades , in an overcrowded discotheque with one available exit , killed 62 and injured 162 .
Some jumped from windows .
Most victims died from smoke inhalation .
Almost all were immigrant teenagers
representing 19 nationalities .
The fire 's cause remains undetermined .
Its speed and a report of teens ejected earlier suggest arson .
Evidence also points to a short-circuit .
Firemen , accused of slow response ,
arrived 6 minutes after deciphering a call in poor Swedish .
Identifying victims was slow
because many were too young for drivers licenses .
A memorial was held at Goteborg Cathedral .
The hall , rated for 150 but packed with 400 ,
was rented to Kurdish students who organized the party .
