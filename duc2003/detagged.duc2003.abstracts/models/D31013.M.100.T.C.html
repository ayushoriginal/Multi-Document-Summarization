Since 1993 ,
three doctors , three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been murdered
and there have been more than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers .
Arson and bombings of clinics have become commonplace .

Viewed by admirers as brave and conscientious ,
he was shot by a sniper .
His death has become an anti-abortion violence issue in two N.Y. .
