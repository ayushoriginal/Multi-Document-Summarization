Typhoon Babs slammed into the Philippines in mid-October killing at least 150 people , injuring hundreds ,
and forcing hundreds of thousands to abandon homes damaged or destroyed by winds , floods , and landslides .
Worst hit was a coconut-producing area
whose damage toll subsequently caused a significant localized rise in cooking oil prices
and contributed to inflationary pressures .
Fund-raising campaigns began with a one-year salary donation by the Philippine 's president .
The powerful storm also brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan
where floods forced hundreds from their homes .
Hong Kong was lashed with strong winds , forcing authorities to open shelters and close beaches .
