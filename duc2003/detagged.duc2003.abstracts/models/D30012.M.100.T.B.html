The Earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on about the same date ,
but only once in approximately every 33 years do heavy bombardments occur .
The meteors are mostly microscopic fragments of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle .
This year , Asians were treated to the most spectacular view .
Meteor sightings peaked at slightly more than 2,000 per hour
- barely one-tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during the great 1966 Leonid storm .
Many of the world 's 600-plus satellites were maneuvered to reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit .
No problems were reported .
Scientists conducted many experiments to further knowledge about meteor storms .
