A total of 248 people ,
including a dozen Americans , were killed in the terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on August 7 , 1998 .
A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania killed 11 people , all Africans .
Osama bin Laden is the suspected mastermind of the bombings .
Through the Saudis , the United States asked the Taliban , the Islamic movement
that controls most of Afghanistan ,
to deport bin Laden ,
but they refused .
Evidence suggests that the terror suspects accused in the bombings , regardless of their nationality or place of residence , are associates of bin Laden or associated with terrorist groups under his control .
