By October 1998 Brazil~Rs economy had ground to a halt .
The rampant inflation had been stopped ,
but deficit spending continued ,
as did a huge trade deficit .
Following the Russian default on foreign loans in August , foreign capital flew out of Brazil
even though interest rates skyrocketed , almost overnight , to 40 % .
Prior to the November election the president began seeking monumental help from the International Monetary Fund
and enlisting support from the United States and other Group of Seven and western hemisphere leaders .
After his narrow election ,
he hoped to institute austere measures ,
drastically cutting spending
and improving tax collection efforts .
