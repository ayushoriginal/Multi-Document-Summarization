The House voted to open a formal impeachment inquiry into the Clinton/Lewinsky affair Thursday ,
but the outcome of the process is unpredictable
and is somewhat dependent on the results of the November elections .
Several Democratic incumbents in the Senate , among them Barbara Boxer and Carol Mosely-Braun , and at least one Senate Republican , Alfonso D' Amato , are in tight races .
If the Republicans take control of the Senate by a large margin , some will view it as a mandate to move toward impeachment .
Alternatively , modest Republican gains in Congress could be a signal
that the citizenry has rejected impeachment .
