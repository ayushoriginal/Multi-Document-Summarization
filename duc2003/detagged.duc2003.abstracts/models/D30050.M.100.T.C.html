With many Democrat seats in jeopardy , 
Republicans expect modest to high gains in both the House and Senate 1998 races .
Several independent analysts also believe that Republicans will gain many of the tightly contested seats .
In Illinois Republican Peter Fitzgerald holds a strong lead over the incumbent Democrat Senator Carol Mosely-Braun .
Perhaps less typical is New York State ,
where Democratic challenger Schumer has battled to a statistical tie with incumbent Republican Senator D' Amato .
As campaign tactics , both skewed their political ideology toward the center ,
with each accusing the other of extremism .
The effect of President Clinton 's impeachment hearings on these elections is unknown .
