The U.N. war crimes tribunal created to investigate evidence of atrocities issued its third conviction
when a Bosnian Serb confessed to 14 murders .
At the trial of four guards accused of atrocities against Serbs at a Bosnian prison , the tribunal considered a lesser sentence against one guard because of evidence of mental disorder .
A potential witness for the tribunal survived a massacre in Kosovo that killed 13 ethnic Albanians .
Belgrade has refused to allow the tribunal to probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo .
The U.S. unanimously disagrees with Yugoslavia 's contention
that Kosovo is off limits and insists on compliance with investigations .
