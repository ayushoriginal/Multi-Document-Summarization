The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission ,
chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu ,
completed a lengthy study of human rights violations ,
including torture and murder , in that country , 1960-1994 .
The apartheid government was the most culpable
but the African National Congress also had a share of the blame .
The `` truth '' part of the report was the easiest :
it listed crimes and named names ,
including former president Botha , Inkatha leader Buthelezi , and even Winnie Mandela .
Information implicating former president de Klerk was withheld .
Reconciliation promised to be more difficult .
Amnesty was proposed for those
who came forward ( perhaps within a given period ) ,
confessed , and requested amnesty .
