Three months after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa , a U.S court indicted Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden for the attacks .
Bin Laden is possibly in Afghanistan ,
protected by the Taliban ,
which has refused a Saudi request to expel him .
Reportedly , however , the Taliban might try him for the earlier bombing of the American barracks in Dhahran .
Three suspects jailed in Manhattan for the embassy bombings are allegedly associated with bin Laden or the network of anti-U.S. militants that support his objectives .
Recently , the State Department admitted receiving an intelligence report
forewarning of the Nairobi embassy attack .
