In October 1988 China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Perhaps emboldened by that , dissidents pushed for the recognition of a new China Democratic Party .
The government , citing a long-standing policy ,
said that it would not tolerate another political party .
Three prominent dissidents , one of them Wu Xenli ,
working to establish the new party were arrested .
They were accused of endangering national security ,
and faced prison terms of five years .
Prospective defense lawyers were intimidated .
The United States criticized the arrests ,
and an embassy official was rebuffed
when he tried to observe a trial .
