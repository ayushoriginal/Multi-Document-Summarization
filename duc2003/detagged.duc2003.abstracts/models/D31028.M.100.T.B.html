Hurricane Georges , with winds up to 135 mph , plowed over
and past 17 Caribbean islands for 11 days in September 1998 ,
causing billions of dollars in destruction
and killing at least 500 people .
The numbers of homeless are staggering ,
with more than 100,000 people left homeless in the Dominican Republic alone .
U.S. taxpayers are sure to foot most of the bill in Puerto Rico ,
where 30,000 homes were destroyed
and another 60,000 damaged .
The Caribbean tourist industry 's position remained good
since many important tourist destinations were spared .
The varied island societies prepared and reacted to Hurricane Georges in radically different ways .
