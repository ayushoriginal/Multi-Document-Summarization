Philippines Airlines ( PAL ) , Asia 's oldest airline ,
devastated in 1998 by pilot and ground worker strikes and with a rising $ 2.1 billion debt , stopped all operations for 13 days .
A 10-year , no-strike agreement was finally ratified
when the government began using foreign carriers for domestic flights .
PAL resumed domestic flights on October 7 and international flights slowly over the next weeks .
This shutdown had been another blow to the debt ridden national flag carrier .
Following the strike , efforts to revive the airlines met more obstacles .
Cathay Pacific Airways would only help
if the payroll , including 200 pilots hired during the pilot strike , were slashed .
