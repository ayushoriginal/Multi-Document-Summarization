All 229 people aboard Swissair 's New York-to-Geneva flight 111 died
when the MD-11 airliner plunged into the sea off the Nova Scotia coast on September 2 , 1998 .
Pilots reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash .
The specific cause of the tragedy was never determined ,
but suspicions are that an electrical short caused a fire .
Following the crash , Swissair voluntarily disconnected its video-on-demand systems
because they were connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit .
The FAA ordered inspection of two cockpit switches in all MD-11 's
and is considering whether there should be a life expectancy for some airplane wiring .
