On Friday morning , November 6 , 1998 , a red Fiat blew up at a market in Jerusalem .
The two bombers were killed
and 21 others injured .
Netanyahu immediately suspended discussions on ratifying the Wye Peace Accord ,
which would turn an additional 13 % of the West Bank over to Arafat .
The Islamic Jihad was blamed for the blast ,
which exploded prematurely
saving many lives .
President Clinton , Secretary of State Albright , and Egyptian President Mabarak urged the Israelis to continue the ratification process .
Arafat condemned the bombing
and vowed to find the mastermind ,
but castigated Netanyahu for using the bombing as an excuse to derail the accord .
