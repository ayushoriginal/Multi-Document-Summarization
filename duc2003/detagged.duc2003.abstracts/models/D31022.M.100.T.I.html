The worst fire in Swedish history occurred on October 29 , 1998 ,
when a Goteborg dancehall ,
jammed with teenaged immigrants ,
burst into flame .
By November 2 , the death toll stood at 62 , with 162 injured ,
17 of whom were still in intensive care .
Officials had not yet determined the cause .
Four hundred people had been crowded into a hall
approved for only 150 .
Fire blocked one exit and the other exit contained furniture .
Rescuers took 6 minutes to arrive ,
after having trouble understanding the accented call for help ,
but the fire spread very rapidly .
The dead included individuals with 19 different nationalities .
