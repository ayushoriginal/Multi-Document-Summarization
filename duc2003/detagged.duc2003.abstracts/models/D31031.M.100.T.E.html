Congressional work on the budget was marked along party lines
as Democrats sought to include more funding for social and environmental issues
while the Republicans sought to push tax cut issues as well as seeking changes to the IMF .
When Congress failed to adopt a budget by the end of the fiscal year ,
it voted a continuing spending resolution
to keep the government operating .
As talks bogged down , the threat of another government shutdown began to loom .
Republicans , wanting to keep public focus on the Clinton impeachment proceedings ,
backed away from some of the more unpopular riders on the bills , especially some anti-environment issues .
