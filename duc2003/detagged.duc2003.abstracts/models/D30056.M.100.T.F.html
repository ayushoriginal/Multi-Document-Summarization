Three British and one New Zealand telecom workers were kidnapped
after a shootout between their bodyguards and the attackers .
One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded in the abduction in the breakaway Chechnya region .
Kidnapping , generally for ransom , has become a growth industry for Chechen rebels with 176 abducted this year .
Most kidnappings are for ransom and 90 of the victims have been released .
The four foreigners were not so fortunate ;
their severed heads were found two months later after a lengthy search .
Chechen authorities called the deaths a major blow to efforts for independence
and blamed `` outside forces '' and their Chechen henchmen .
