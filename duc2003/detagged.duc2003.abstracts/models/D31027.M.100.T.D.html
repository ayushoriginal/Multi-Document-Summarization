Election of members to serve in the Assembly of Experts occurred on 23 October 1998 .
The 86-member cleric-based Assembly is important
because it names and supervises the country 's supreme leader .
The conservatives ' decisive victory was inevitable
because the conservative-dominated 12-member Council of Guardians
that passed judgment on the list of candidates rejected all except 30 of the moderate candidates .
Moderate supporters of President Khatami publicly protested the action of the conservative screening council .
Moderates threatened to boycott the election ,
and voter turnout was unusually low .
Conservative hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly .
