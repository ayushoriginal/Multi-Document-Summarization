After a delay of almost two years because of security questions , the Palestinians opened their first international airport in a rare example of cooperation between Israel and Palestine .
Israel will continue to share security responsibilities at the airport with the Palestinians .
An Egypt Air plane was the first
to touch down at the newly opened Gaza International Airport .
The highlight , however , was the landing of the first Palestinian Airlines plane .
Security concerns continue to plague the running of the airport
as Israeli security officials first threatened to close down the airport
and later delayed the departure of two planes because of security disputes .
