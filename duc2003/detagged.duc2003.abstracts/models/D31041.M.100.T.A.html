Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) experienced a crisis in 1998 .
Unable to make payments on a $ 2.1 billion debt ,
it was faced by a pilot 's strike in June and the region 's currency problems
which reduced passenger numbers
and inflated costs .
On September 23 PAL shut down
after the ground crew union turned down a settlement
which it accepted two weeks later .
PAL resumed domestic flights on October 7 and international flights on October 26 .
Resolution of the basic financial problems was elusive , however ,
and as of December 18 PAL was still $ 2.2 billion in debt
and losing close to $ 1 million a day .
