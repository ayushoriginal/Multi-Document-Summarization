Making obvious their intention to suppress the fledging China Democratic Party ,
Communist officials arrested three of its most prominent leaders , Xu Wenli , Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai .
Colleagues protested
and the USA expressed concern , to no avail .
China , defending its action ,
brought all three to trial .
Because potential defense lawyers were harassed , all three had to defend themselves .
Qin and Wang were charged with inciting subversion ,
which carries a minimum sentence of five years imprisonment .
Xu faces the more serious charge of subverting state power
which can bring a life sentence .
Chinese President Jiang said multiparty democracy will not be allowed .
