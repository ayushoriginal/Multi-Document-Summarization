The fate of Asia 's oldest airline , PAL , is uncertain .
Negotiations with Cathay Pacific Airways
to infuse $ 100 million dollars into the company collapsed
when PAL Chairman Tan refused to agree to major job cuts
and to relinquish management control to Cathay .
PAL is buried under a $ 2.2 billion dollar debt
it cannot repay and $ 1 million a day losses .
A replacement investor is unlikely
and President Estrada , though supported by Tan in the election ,
has rejected a government bailout .
PAL 's financial troubles were exacerbated by a two-week shutdown in September due to a dispute with its largest union .
