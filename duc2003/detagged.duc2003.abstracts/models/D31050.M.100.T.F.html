Chinese officials have finally spoken out on their dealings with dissidents
trying to establish the China Democracy Party .
They claimed
that Xu Wenli , was suspected of `` activities damaging to national security '' .
The US has denounced China 's detaining those `` peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms '' .
Those arrested are expected to be tried under China 's vague State Security Law .
Obtaining lawyers for their trials became virtually impossible forcing some of the dissidents to defend themselves .
President Zemin said
that economic reforms would continue
but would not be a prelude to multiparty democracy .
China did release ailing Liu Nianchun from prison work camp
and exiled him to the US .
