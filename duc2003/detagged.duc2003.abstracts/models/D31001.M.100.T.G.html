A South African panel probing the apartheid-era abuses is releasing its final report
following a 2-year investigation . The panel , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
( ARC ) , found
that most violations of human rights were through government security and law enforcement agencies .
However , the panel has also accused the African National Congress ( ANC ) of human rights violations .
The last apartheid president , F. W. de Klerk , will not be implicated in the rights violations after threatening a court challenge .
The goal of the ARC is to create an idealistic reconciliation of all citizens through amnesty
rather than hold politically divisive trials .
