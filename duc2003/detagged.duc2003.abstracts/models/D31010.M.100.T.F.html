An Arctic cold wave brought unusually cold November weather across Europe .
Southern Italy experienced snowfall and even Moscow , noted for cold weather ,
felt the wrath of the early cold spell .
Many deaths were attributed to the cold
with Poland apparently the hardest hit .
The death toll there was greatest among the homeless , especially those
who passed out drinking alcohol .
In all , 85 deaths there were due to the cold
where temperatures dipped as low as minus 26 degrees Celsius .
Frostbite and hypothermia sent many to the hospital .
Rail schedules throughout Europe were disrupted ,
ports were closed
and many autos were stranded on snow-covered highways .
