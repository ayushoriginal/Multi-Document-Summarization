In October 1998 , under pressure from Turkey , Syria expelled Abdullah Ocalan , leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) ,
identified as a terrorist organization . .
Ocalan was rumored to be in Russia .
Turkey asked Russia to extradite Ocalan ,
but Russia would not even confirm his presence there .
In mid-November Ocalan suddenly arrived in Rome on a flight from Moscow
and was immediately arrested .
Turkey called for Ocalan=s extradition from Italy .
Although as a NATO ally Italy might grant Turkey 's request ,
it had consistently refused to extradite anyone facing the death penalty
as Ocalan clearly would in Turkey ,
so the outcome remained in doubt .
