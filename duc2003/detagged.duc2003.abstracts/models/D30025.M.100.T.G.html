Brazilian President Cardoso won his first-round re-election
because voters trusted his economic management more than that of his chief rival .
However , Brazil has serious financial problems due to money depreciation and large trade and budget deficits , particularly after becoming caught up in the financial turmoil
that began in Southeast Asia with foreign investment pullouts .
The IMF and the U.S. could provide an aid package pending evidence of a promising economic recovery plan that would cut government expenses .
Gubernatorial elections will be important
because governors control a considerable share of the national budget and could be told to cut local budgets .
