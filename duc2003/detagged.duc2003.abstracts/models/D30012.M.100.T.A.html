Optimum viewing of the Leonid meteor shower in November 1998 was forecast for East Asia .
Some predicted the shower to rival the greatest of the century in 1966 ,
others said it would be more modest .
Meteor showers are hard to predict .
Of particular concern in 1998 was the danger posed by the storms to earth-orbiting satellites .
Some satellites were repositioned to be less likely targets ,
but authorities differed as to the real danger .
Scientists studied the showers with various airborne instruments .
In fact , the showers were more impressive viewed from Europe than East Asia and there was no damage to satellites .
