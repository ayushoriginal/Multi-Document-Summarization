Iranian pro-democracy demonstrators protested the action of the conservative , 12-member Council of Guardians
that rejected 214 of 400 candidates
who wished to run in the national election for the 86-member Assembly of Experts .
This assembly elects and supervises the country 's supreme leader ,
who has final say in all things .
In vetting these aspirants ,
the council eliminated most reformist supporters of President Mohammad Khatami , a moderate clergyman with wide popular support .
In the heavy boycotted election that followed ,
hard-liners , not surprisingly , won 54 of the 86 seats ;
moderates won 13 ,
and independents 3. 
Sixteen seats went to candidates whose affiliation is unclear .
