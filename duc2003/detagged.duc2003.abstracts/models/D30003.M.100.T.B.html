British authorities arrested General Augusto Pinochet , in London for back surgery , on an international warrant
issued by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon .
The Madrid court charged Pinochet ,
who ruled Chile as a despot for 17 years ,
with crimes against humanity ,
including genocide and terrorism , involving the deaths of more than 4,000 people .
The Chilean government protested that Pinochet , now a `` senator-for-life , '' has legal immunity ,
but few in Chilean society protested the arrest .
Pinochet 's arrest shows the growing significance of international human-rights law ,
suggesting that officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hide these days ,
even if they are carrying diplomatic passports .
