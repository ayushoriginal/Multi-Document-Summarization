The opening of the Gaza International Airport was stipulated by the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord .
Palestinians marked the event with euphoria .
The airport will ease the claustrophobia of Gazans
and provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy .
Many Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence .
Although security remains in Israeli hands , Palestinians will no longer have to travel to Jordan or Israel to travel abroad .
Flights are sometimes delayed
when the Palestinians and Israelis disagree on security procedures .
Since Wye , Israel and Palestine have accused one another of reneging on agreements ,
and Israel has frozen the accords .
