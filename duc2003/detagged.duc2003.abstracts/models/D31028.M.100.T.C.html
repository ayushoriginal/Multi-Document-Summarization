For eleven days in September , Hurricane Georges 110-135 mph winds plowed across the Caribbean ,
killing at least 500 people
and inflicting more than $ 5 billion in property damage before expiring over Georgia .
The numbers of homeless is staggering .
Hard-hit Antigua , Cuba , the Dominican Republic , Puerto Rico and St. Kitts will be hurt further by the continuing loss of tourism .
Fortunately , many tourist areas escaped unscathed : the Windward Island group , Trinidad and Tobago , the Dutch Islands , the Bahamas , Cayman Islands , Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos .
U.S. aid will be needed for rebuilding , 
particularly in underinsured Puerto Rico
and destitute Haiti .
