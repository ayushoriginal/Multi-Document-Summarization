Dr. Barnett Slepian , an obstetrician
who performed abortions at Buffalo Women 's Gynecological Services clinic , was killed by a sniper 's bullet
as he stood in the kitchen of his home .
His slaying is the most deadly example of what law-enforcement officials describe as an annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and western New York .
Slepian 's killer is still at large .
Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment ,
and had received a warning earlier on the day he was slain about possible attacks against abortion providers .
Slepian 's death has become a factor in several political campaigns in New York .
