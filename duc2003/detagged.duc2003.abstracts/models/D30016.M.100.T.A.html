Swiss Air flight 111 crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2 , 1998
killing all 129 passengers and crew .
The cause has not been determined ,
but there was extreme heat damage to the front of the aircraft and it is suspected
that an in-flight entertainment system had electrical problems .
Swiss Air , while insisting that the system was installed correctly ,
has disconnected the system in other aircraft as a precaution .
The airline immediately offered $ 20,000 to families of the victims
and ,
having opted out of a $ 75,000 liability cap ,
began work on a plan to provide compensation of approximately $ 137,000 per family .
