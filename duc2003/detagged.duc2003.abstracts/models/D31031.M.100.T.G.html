Five days before money for the new fiscal year was to run out , Democrats accused the Republicans of deliberately moving slow on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government from closing down .
The situation was complicated by Republicans promoting bills with anti-environmental riders subject to veto by the President , plus demands for full funding for IMF .
The Republicans began to back down , however , apparently to focus more on impeachment
and to prepare for November elections .
They compromised on environmental issues , a much smaller tax cut plan , and a conditional loan to the IMF
to avert international economic crisis .
