A car bomb exploded in a Jerusalem market Friday
killing two assailants and wounding 21 Israelis .
The militant group Hamas claimed responsibility .
The incident caused the Israelis to suspend ratification of a U.S.-brokered Wye River accord
calling for Israel to give Palestine 13 % of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants .
Arafat promised to hunt the masterminds of the bombing
and urged the Israelis not to halt the accord .
Some believe the failure of the attack indicates
Arab-Israeli efforts are weakening the militants .
The president of Egypt is skeptical that the Israelis will implement the accord .
