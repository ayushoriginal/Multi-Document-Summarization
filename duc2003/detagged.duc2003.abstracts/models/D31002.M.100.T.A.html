In October 1998 Pope John Paul II visited Croatia
where , at Marija Bystrica , he beatified Cardinal Stepinac , archbishop of Zagreb during World War II. Revered by Croats as an anti-communist martyr ,
Stepinac is regarded by most Serbs as a Nazi sympathizer .
Thus the Pope , while preaching peace , unity , and reconciliation , stirred up enmities in the former Yugoslavia .
After the beatification the Pope moved on to Split
where he called for a more democratic Croatia `` based on the moral values inscribed in the very nature of the human being , ''
and asked the world to do more for victims of the recent Balkan war .
