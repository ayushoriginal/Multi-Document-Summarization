Iran 's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for the 86-member clergy-based Assembly of Experts that oversees the country 's supreme leader .
The results were expected
since the 12-member Council of Guardians ,
dominated by hard-liners ,
had dropped most moderates from the ballot in advance of the election .
Iran 's official media boasted about a huge voter turnout ,
but correspondents , citizens , and others disputed these claims .
Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest stacking the deck .
The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly and the moderates only 13. Most of the other winners lean toward the hard-line camp .
