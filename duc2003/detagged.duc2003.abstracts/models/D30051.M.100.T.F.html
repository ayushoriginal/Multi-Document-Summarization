Violence continues in Yugoslavia
as the International Court in the Hague pushes to have inspectors return
to investigate instances of war crimes .
President Milosevic continues to deny war crimes even amid reports of a massacre ,
described by a survivor , and murders by Serbian police in Kosovo .
The General Assembly voted to add three judges to the war crimes tribunal ,
which scored its first guilty verdicts , one of a Serb
who confessed to killing fourteen .
The war crimes tribunal
branded Yugoslavia a `` rogue state '' for denying entry to inspectors but , later , an agreement was reached to allow inspectors to return in November .
