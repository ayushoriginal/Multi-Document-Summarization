Hurricane Georges , packing winds up to 110 mph ,
swept through the northern Caribbean
killing over 400 people ,
leaving at least 140,000 homeless ,
and causing billions in property damage .
In Puerto Rico alone , though the residents were forewarned of the hurricane 's approach ,
nearly 30,000 houses were destroyed .
The cost of rebuilding the homes will be largely borne by the residents and U.S. taxpayers ,
since most homeowners are uninsured .
Haiti , the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere was a disaster zone .
There , mudslides and floods killed a total of 221 people , 102 in Fonds Verettes .
Georges , however , spared many other Caribbean tourist destinations .
