On December 2 , 1998 , Turkish President Demirel was expected to ask former Deputy Premier Ecevit to create a new government with a secular coalition of his Democratic Left party and two center-right parties .
The last government fell on November 25 ,
following a no confidence vote and rumors that Prime Minister Yilmza had mafia ties .
Demirel did not call on the Islamic Virtue party ,
even though it held the most seats in Parliament , the traditional qualification to form a new government .
He turned instead to Turkey 's strong military and pro-western secular leadership .
Virtue conceded the role , calling any government interim
since the next election will be in April .
