Invoking the Sherman Act ,
the Justice Department and 20 states have begun anti-trust proceedings against Microsoft Corporation .
Key to the government 's case is the allegation , supported by Netscape ,
that Microsoft suggested in a June 1995 meeting
that Netscape join Microsoft in dividing the internet software market .
In a taped deposition , Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates denied any knowledge of such an offer .
Microsoft lawyers later produced an e-mail from Netscape President James Barkdale which suggests
Netscape was a willing participant in the internet software discussion .
Despite the on-going suit , Microsoft made an unsuccessful bid
to acquire the software business behind the Palm Pilot .
