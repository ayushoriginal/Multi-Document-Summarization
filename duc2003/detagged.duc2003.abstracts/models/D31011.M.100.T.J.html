Cooking oil prices rose sharply in the Philippines on speculation
that copra production will decline due to the effects of el Nino and recent typhoons on coconut crops .
Typhoon Babs , which caused 151 fatalities
and forced 400,000 people from their homes ,
was particularly destructive in the Bicol region , a large coconut-production area .
After Babs , President Estrada declared four provinces and a city
to be calamity zones , eligible for emergency funds .
He also jump-started a fund for victims of the typhoons with a contribution equivalent to his yearly salary .
Babs subsequently swept through Taiwan , triggering landslides , and Hong Kong .
