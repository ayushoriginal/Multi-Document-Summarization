Turkish President Demirel will meet Deputy Premier Ecevit ,
fueling speculation that Ecevit will lead the government
following Prime Minister Yilmazi 's ouster over corruption charges .
Ecevit proposed a new secular coalition combining his party with those
headed by Yilmaz and former premier Ciller .
Reportedly , Ecevit is supported by Turkey 's powerful , pro-Western military .
Traditionally , the Islamic Virtue Party would establish the new government
since it holds the most seats in Parliament ,
but the constitution mandates a strictly secular republic .
Furthermore , the military would not support an Islamic government .
The government crisis comes during negotiations with Italy
to extradite PKK rebel leader , Ocalan .
