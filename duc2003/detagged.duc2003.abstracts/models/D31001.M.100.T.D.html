South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established
to clear the air after the ugly apartheid struggle .
Retired Archbishop Tutu headed the Commission .
It worked two plus years ,
holding countrywide meetings .
It was controversial from the start .
Commission leaks prompted de Klerk , the last white President , to threaten a court challenge
The final 3,500-page report was issued on 29 October 1998 .
The white majority received the greater blame for rights violations ,
but the black ANC was also cited .
De Klerk 's name did not appear in the report .
Botha , the Inkatha Party , the ruling ANC , and Winnie Mandela were specifically cited .
