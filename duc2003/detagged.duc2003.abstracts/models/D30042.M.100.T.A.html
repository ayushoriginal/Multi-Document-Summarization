In 1998 two Libyans indicted in 1991 for the Lockerbie bombing were still in Libya .
In 1992 the U . N. voted sanctions against Libya for its refusal to turn over the suspects .

Then , in late November , the U . N. Secretary General hinted that he might broker an agreement .
Optimism arose ,
but the issue was still in doubt .
