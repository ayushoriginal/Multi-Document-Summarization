London bombing: Police search houses in Leeds

Tuesday, July 12, 2005

West Yorkshire Police searched six houses in Leeds today in connection with the London bombings. Houses were searched in the Burley, Beeston and Holbeck areas. Further properties were searched in Dewsbury, about eight miles from the city centre. The raids began at 6:30am BST this morning after warrants were issued under the Terrorism Act 2000. Police are still in attendance at one property, and are describing the searches as significant, and "intelligence led".

Access to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion. Other houses were entered by armed police.

London Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation "is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday". A "significant amount" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property. Following the discovery of the explosive, military bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene. Around 600 people were evacuated from the surrounding area. Temporary food and shelter is being provided by the local council at Kirkstall Leisure Centre, a mile away.
