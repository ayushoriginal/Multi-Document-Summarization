At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow.
But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier.
On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma in critical condition.
At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder.
Two women described as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree murder.
Shepard's friends said that he did not know his alleged tormentors.
Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery, although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have been a factor.
Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime.
He was very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology student here, said of her friend.
I admired him for that because it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree.
A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's.
He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two men came up and talked to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of social work here, said today between tears.
He indicated he was gay, and they said they were gay, too.
Now, he is in a coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday.
I don't think anybody expects him to pull through.
Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia.
Matthew Shepard was born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his youth there.
But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip.
Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people.
Set in a treeless landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains.
Although Wyoming often bills itself as the equality state, in reference to its being the first state to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly voted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special rights.
Wyoming is not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne.
The best way to characterize that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing plant.
Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university within days.
One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and straights.
He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled the bartender, Matt Galloway.
He wasn't drunk when he went out.
Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck.
Beating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged.
There, it said, the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum while he begged for his life.
Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body.
After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the fence.
The police commander said that when his officers arrested the two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card.
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
The police commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks.
Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson.
Ms. Price lived with McKinney.
The police did not say what the other three did for a living.
On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled to understand the incident.
Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plans on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998.
The weeklong series of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of National Coming Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian families.
If I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside.
Openly gay behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous.

As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as Wyoming's hometown, wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men.
On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, Pistol Pete and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger group of marchers 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week.
Hate is not a Small Town Value No to Violence and Evil, read one sign, as watchers applauded.
With passersby spontaneously joining the protest group, two women held another sign that read, No Hate Crimes in Wyoming.
Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches near the campus.
At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets to other patients.
A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew about 500 people.
We live in the Equality State, Shannon Rexroat wrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus newspaper.
Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state to grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's editor added : That means nothing to me anymore.
We live in a state where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay.
But others recalled another side of Wyoming's hometown,''which has a population of more than 26,000.
Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday he was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed away from him and used an anti-gay epithet.
Last week's brutal assault bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang.
This incident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying motive, wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson.
Gay people in Laramie, they wrote, are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, insult and hostility if not guns and ropes.
Ric Turley, who dropped out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized billboard on the main highway.
Under a brace of pistols, an advertising appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from Shoot a Day or Two, to Shoot a Gay or Two.
Turley, who is gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that he immediately complained to the museum.
But returning a month later, he found the message had not been erased.
After complaining to the museum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint and blotted out the word gay.
It was this kind of complacency and apathy that allowed this to happen, he said of the beating in which two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney.
According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men lured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay.
Then, the Laramie police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a .357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until a passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious.
On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated.
McKinney was being treated for a minor skull fracture unrelated to the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective.
President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, I was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew Shepard.
Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act, saying, There is nothing more important to the future of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice and violent bigotry.
Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have a hate crime law.
The latest attempt died in the state Legislature in Cheyenne in February.
On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, said he was outraged and sickened by the attack.
Here in Laramie, McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack.
His pickup truck was apparently used in the kidnapping.
But he also complained about the massive attention by the national media.
The national press blew it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual, McKinney told The Denver Post.
Had this been a heterosexual these two boys decided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national news.
Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was transferred to Saudi Arabia.
The young man completed high school at a boarding school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German.
On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement from Fort Collins thanking the American public for their kind thoughts about Matthew.
He is a trusting person who takes everybody at face value and he does not see the bad side of anyone, the Shepards wrote.
He has always strongly felt that all people are the same, regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion.
Noting that their son was born prematurely and that his life has often been a struggle, they added, He is physically short in stature, but we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth of others.
Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted them.
From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby.
Two men and two women have been charged in the case.
The men were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charges that could bring the death penalty.
There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington.
People have likened it to a scarecrow.
But it sounded more like a crucifixion.
Gay leaders hope and Christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws.
Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over another.
In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation.
Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws.
Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex, disability and sexual orientation.
Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February.
But Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov.
Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.
I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January, Geringer said.
The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his son's death to become a media circus and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda.
Geringer said that Shepard's father also said : Don't rush into just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws.
Be very careful of any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process to race to this.
Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday.
But they added that they hoped the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation.
Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding of hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has 250,000 members.
Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.
In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities.
According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom of speech.
Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending faith, family and freedom.
It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said.
This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists.
Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality through religious conversion.
We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norms, said Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals.
Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television advertisements that preach the healing of homosexuality through religious conversion.
Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can lead to violence.
Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J.
Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities.
We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they escalate, he said.
Referring to murders of homosexuals, he added : These crimes are preventable.
Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished the first time.
Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered higher rates of violent crime than the population at large.
He also said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger.
The two men charged in the killing of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22.
With other crimes, violence is a means to an end.
With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal, Levin said.
Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull.
Because their social stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets, Levin added.
Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said : The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.
While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism : the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders.
This University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest and open about being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death can not be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals.
His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said.

Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charges that could bring the death penalty.
Their girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, were charged as accessories.
In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness Week.
In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half-staff in the Castro district.
There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington.
People have likened it to a scarecrow.
But it sounded more like a crucifixion.
Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said they believed robbery was the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000.
But investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor.
Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him.
Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18.
McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital where Shepard died.

On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington.
It was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year.
This particular press conference was to announce a new barrage of ads a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign in which alleged former homosexuals who have changed implore others to do likewise through the power of Jesus Christ.
The commercials, gooey in style, end with a slogan : It's not about hate ...
It's about hope.
But it's really about stirring up the fear that produces hate.
If these ads were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks before Election Day.
The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating of hope, ooze malice.
In one of them, homosexuality is linked to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly posit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure.
Matthew Shepard has now been cured, that's for sure.
As his uncle, R.W.
Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to a career in diplomacy and human rights, was a small person with a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him.
Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's like something you might see in war.
And a war it is.
Go to the Family Research Council's Web site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of family.
'' The head of the Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization hates no one and deplores violence.
But if you wage a well-financed media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual orientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and un-American seekers of special rights, ground war will follow.
It's a story as old as history.
Once any group is successfully scapegoated as a subhuman threat to normal values by a propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over.
Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting discriminatory treatment by their own party.
The gay-bashers had been directly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians : Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on TV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its Gay Days; the Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan.
Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent Lott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay people as sinful and sick.
A frightened gay Texas Republican who had been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then : Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck to stop this?
Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved Lott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares take on its religious wing and its crusade against people like Matthew Shepard.
In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free crusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the bad choice of being gay.
Is it that mother who speaks for American values, or is it Matthew's?
Go home, give your kids a hug, Judy Shepard said in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let a day go by without telling them you love them.
Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins.
Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint : I'm Gay.
Few people missed the message.
Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming freshman, was savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a position that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow.
Tuesday, officials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha.
The fraternity chapter immediately suspended seven members and said they had acted independently.
But in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being held on campuses across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility toward gay people often flourishes in high schools and universities, gay leaders said Tuesday.
People would like to think that what happened to Matthew was an exception to the rule but, it was an extreme version of what happens in our schools on a daily basis, said Kevin Jennings, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the schools.
Shepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning from the injuries suffered in the beating.
He never regained consciousness after being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hours after he was lashed to the fence.
Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder charges.
Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, 18, have been arraigned as accessories after the fact.
In response to the killing, about 50 candelight vigils were scheduled this week, from Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City.
At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was in intensive care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences.
Tuesday, when funeral arrangements were announced for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital Web site received 30,000 hits an hour.
Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate crime legislation.
I see his name going down in gay history as a catalyst for renewed activism, said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization in New York.
From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed that campus homophobia is not restricted to college towns in the Rocky Mountain West.
Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the past year.
These percentages were about five times greater than the percentages of heterosexual respondents.
The survey was conducted at 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education.
In a separate study of nearly 500 community college students in the San Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondents said they had verbally threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened or assaulted gay people.
The study was conducted this year by Karen Franklin, a forensic psychologist who is a researcher at the University of Washington.
Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late 1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally harassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying group based in Washington.
Last year, a student group in Des Moines, Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations at five high schools on 10 homophobia recording day.
They estimated that the average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay remarks every day.
Nine out of 10 teaching tolerance courses weed out gays, Foreman said.
There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism and anti-semitism.
But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes, to express anti-gay sentiments.
In a survey of the nation's 42 largest school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues facing gay students, and 42 percent do not have policies to protect students from discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last month.
In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled with an electronic avalanche of condolences, city police detectives were investigating a different kind of e-mail.
On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, two gay organizations, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder.
The messages closed with the words : I hope it happens more often.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded, his cousin, the Rev.
Anne Kitch, said in a homily that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station.
Judging from the world's response, she said, Matt will have made a difference in the lives of thousands.
As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robes of an Episcopal acolyte.
There is an image that comes to mind when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence, said the Rev.
Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy.
I replace that image with that of another man hung upon a cross.
When I concentrate on that man, I can release the bitterness inside.
Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
In death, he has become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety.
His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution that condemned Shepard's killing as outrageous and that urged each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen to denounce this outrageous murder of another human being.
In one of the largest rallies, about 1,000 people, including members of Congress of both parties, gathered on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn the Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of Now!
Now!
Now.
We will never forget the love that the world has shared with this kind, loving son, said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping.
He said the family was touched beyond measure by the thousands of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support.
Before the funeral, about a dozen protesters, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual messages.
But mourners stood in front of them, singing Amazing Grace and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends and family members entering the church.
On hearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests during funerals.
Wyoming Gov.
Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protesters were just flat not welcome.
The governor, a Republican, added, What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in.
Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several years of high school and college here.
With flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many mourners were his old classmates.
Others traveled here, one driving from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard this, said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 miles to wait three hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never met.
I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.
Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters.
At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of Shepard.
Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green symbolizes peace.
In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword.
Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black bias, The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in its main editorial on Sunday.
Violence against our homosexual friends and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation.
Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote lovingly that, Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place called Wyoming.
Matt was very short and hard to hug, Marsden recalled of the young man who had grown up in Casper.
But it was worth trying, because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile frame.
In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to God's plan.
On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east of Laramie.
Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebars.
Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of the day, Kreifels recalled, I noticed something out of my eye that looked like a scarecrow.
I walked around the fence, and as I got closer, I noticed the hair.
Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious.
Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to die, Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb.
But I guess God wanted his parents to be with him.
