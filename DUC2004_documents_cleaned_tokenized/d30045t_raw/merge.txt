Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.
It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing.
If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue.
A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News.
The reported talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the No.
2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years.
A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue.
Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday.
Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment.
Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.
Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies : Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil.
Both Exxon, which has a market value of$ 176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of$ 61.1 billion, have a history of being fiercely independence.
Both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods when oil prices are low.
But this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon.
Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners.
This summer, British Petroleum announced a$ 48.2 billion agreement to buy Amoco Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation.
It showed that megamergers are doable, said Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex.
Brown.
He added, however, that a combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge.
Exxon, he added, is a well run company that likes to grow its own businesses.
He added that the heads of both companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different personalities.
It will not be easy, he said of combining the two far-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United States and Europe.
If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added.
Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term.
Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia.
Even though they were prepared to spend billions, they have held back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials and oil companies to give up control of vast fields.
Thus they have had to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.
Such exploration is very expensive, and even when large fields are found it often takes platforms costing$ 1 billion to bring the oil into production.
Oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent from the$ 20-a-barrel level because of growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there.
On Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to$ 11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of$ 11.42 reached on June 15.
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production.
But those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil market this year have proven short-lived.
OPEC members on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks, and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday.
In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels.
The main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil prices from falling below$ 10 a barrel.
Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions.
The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco.
An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry such a merger would control.
Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of the possible merger.
Some pointed to difficulties that the companies could face if they were combined.
If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank based in New York.
It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to gain.
In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses.
They really do overlap quite a bit, he said.
You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy.
Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the discussed merger.
When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, the banker said.
But none of those reasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.
But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for projects in Middle Eastern countries.
This is a deal that makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said.
With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big.
In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the merger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas of the world where they had little influence.
There are a lot of complimentary assets where they are not redundant, she said.
She said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil does not.
And Mobil has significant assets in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.

As oil prices have plummeted to levels last seen in the mid-1980s, oil companies have been under pressure to cut costs.
Exxon, which has a market value of$ 176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of$ 61.1 billion, both have histories of being fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of low oil prices.

Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten.
In energy as in businesses like financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary.
Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago.
Crude oil prices have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels, adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo 25 years ago.
As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting their costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue operating profitably with such low prices.
Exxon and Mobil are the two largest, strongest competitors to emerge from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust.
Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger than either of them.
They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC made far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer to buy Amoco Corp. for$ 48.2 billion.
Industry executives say further deals on this scale are inevitable.
Executives at both companies did not return calls Thursday for comment on the talks, and it was unclear Thursday night what the outcome might be.
But if Exxon and Mobil agree to become one, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart.
Even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them.
The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer, said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees.
Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely to lose their jobs.
Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, with Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executives who have been preoccupied with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary.
Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s.
Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed prices.
They're pitiful, helpless giants, said Ronald Chernow, the author of Titan, a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder.
As such, these giants are compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their huge, expensive international projects that are needed to develop oil reserves needed for the next century.
Mobil, with$ 58.4 billion in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything.
But in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match Shell's offer to build a pipeline for$ 1 billion or more.
Oil companies have decided that they can not count on a rebound in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon.
Earlier this month, the Energy Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as$ 5.50 a barrel in the year 2000.
And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices.
Moreover, improving technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is on hand now.
In response, many energy companies have already begun a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations.
To further reduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop short of full mergers.
Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its European refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, resulting in annual savings of about$ 500 million.
Shell and Texaco then formed a refining partnership in the United States.
In the face of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, if you're an Exxon, how do you compete?
Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s.
Thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies through acquired companies like Citgo.
Under Noto, Mobil has been hunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive.
He took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered buying up smaller companies.
And he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal.
In the European agreement with British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos have gone up.
As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin& AMP; Jenrette, If the price is right, egos will not get in the way.
In the past, Mobil reportedly had further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as well as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture.
The company was also interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business.
But no deals were reached.
More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street that Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said.
I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger, he said.
The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an expected$ 2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot.
There, Raymond has so far concentrated more on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies.
Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil's size.
Only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of today's best opportunities.
Finding new fields in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platforms costing$ 1 billion or more.
Producing oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and money than many investors anticipated.
In September, Noto was among the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investments in his country, too.
Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations including a huge refinery.
But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital.
Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York.
Even after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained for several years in the same building in Manhattan.
Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united.
British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana.
The break-up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft.
Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft.
Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way Microsoft is, he said.
In the energy business today, he added, there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle.
News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue.
Even before that combination came to light, deal-making was fast and furious.
On Monday alone,$ 40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent.
Driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year.
There are also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into one another's arms.
But for investors, mega-marriages are not where the real money is to be made.
Rather, it is among smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with stocks that again are near their peaks.
If Exxon buys Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more than$ 140 billion off from April's peak of$ 244 billion but three times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling.
Which industries are likely to witness the most mergers?
Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm in New York, says more deals are a certainty in energy, which is suffering from low crude-oil prices.
Burnett also says health care executives are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings.
But smaller companies may be a better way to play the takeover game.
Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said : Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore.
The values are in small-cap stocks.
Another reason is that deals involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath of antitrust regulators.
LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already partially owned by another.
In the energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by Keyspan Energy.
He also believes more deals are imminent among drug chains and supermarkets.
Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another concern.
In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic& AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany.
Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores that is 55 percent owned by the U.S. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain.
Both A& AMP; P and Smart and Final are trading at just about book value, LaLoggia said.
Takeovers typically occur above book value.
Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading near$ 39, close to its low for the year.
The company has$ 30 a share in cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent.
After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's cross-hairs.
Times are tough in the oil patch.
Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing.
Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration.
Given the exotic locales of the most promising, untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper.
And with West Texas crude trading at around$ 12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet oil that won't be selling for$ 100 a barrel by the turn of the century a price some analysts in the early 1980s were predicting it would reach.
Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business.
Following are excerpts from the conversation : Q.
( italics) There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon-Mobil deal.
Do you see any problems?
( end italics) A.
Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal.
I think it is far from that.
But if it were to happen, I don't see many problems.
BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with.
Exxon-Mobil comes close.
The first issue is competition in local markets.
The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players there.
If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's positions on global warming.
Q.
( italics) Why are you skeptical about the deal?
( end italics) A.
Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger.
They had talks with Amoco.
They wanted to buy Conoco.
But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this.
That could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place, and he has been a very strong leader.
Q.
( italics) Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon.
Why do they need to get bigger?
( end italics) A.
In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game : Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco.
Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal players.
Q.
( italics) That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.
( end italics) A.
From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditures rose 8 percent.
Mobil's rose 14 percent.
But Mobil's expenditures were much more sensitive to price elasticities of oil than Exxon's.
They were pushing the envelope, and when prices fell they had to cut back.
Exxon has tried to build a very large presence systematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices.
They are brutally efficient.
Q.
( italics) Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade.
Do you agree?
( end italics) A.
You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil companies.
I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year.
It is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at$ 5 a barrel, depending on what happens to the world economy.
During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries.
That will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries.
And when the Asian economies start growing again that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say$ 20 a barrel, in the next 18 months.
Q.
( italics) The number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years, regardless, isn't it?
( end italics) A.
We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight.
There is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society.
Q.
( italics) Do you think oil stocks are a good investment?
( end italics) A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 months.
And it is an area where investors need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies.
It was new highs again for the Standard& AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed stocks up.
Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.
Internet and computer stocks also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems.
At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday.
There is no question that the merger euphoria is the headline, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp. But the flow into mutual funds is also strong.
Exxon rose 1 11/16, to 74], while Mobil jumped 7 |, to 86.
Chevron, reflecting the bounce that other oil companies got from the merger news, climbed 5 \, to 85 |.
Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rose 3 \, to 170, were the main drivers of the Dow Jones industrial average.
It climbed 18.80 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,333.08.
It now stands just 41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for the week.
Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S& AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new high, the second of the week.
It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five trading days.
Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 11/16, to 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4 |, to 80], and Microsoft pushed the Nasdaq index to its first new high since July 20.
The technology-heavy index finished 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, at 2,016.44.
It was up 4.6 percent for the week.
Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be known before Monday.
It was a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, at 257 million shares, made it the lightest day of the year.
In the bond market, which also closed early because of the Thanksgiving weekend, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 101 12/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday.
Long-term and short-term yields all slipped lower this week despite new economic data that indicated the economy was stronger in the third quarter than expected and seems to be moving along at a good pace in the current quarter.
This small recovery in the face of stronger growth is probably because new inflation numbers show that prices are in check and analysts are still forecasting that the economy will begin to slow down next year.
Many analysts have noted during the eight-week stock market rally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that investors were buying again even though major financial problems around the world including a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin America and a troubled Russia have not been resolved.
Johnson said he thought that investors, inspired by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in two months and by the new stimulus package in Japan, assume that these problems will be solved.
Investors are looking over the valley and they like what they see, he said.
But he worries that the financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997 and was intensified by the effective default of Russia in August, will not go away quickly.
It seems that in every financial crisis, everybody gets the impression that the storm has passed, Johnson said.
But it is never that easy.
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the prospects were good for completing an agreement.
Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways to combine.
They cautioned, however, that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance they would reach one.
The statement sent the stock of both companies surging, suggesting investors believe the companies will combine.
Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose$ 1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to$ 74.375.
Shares of Mobil, the No.
2 U.S. oil company, rose$ 7.625, or 9.7 percent, to$ 86.
Some analysts said that if the two giants reached an agreement, it was likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil.
Exxon is far larger and financially stronger.
Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people.
Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex.
Brown, said that the companies would probably make cuts to save about$ 3 billion to$ 5 billion a year.
Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares up sharply.
They said the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares.
Based on Mobil's$ 75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about$ 70 billion.
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices.
This is one of the most intelligent chief executives in the business and a man of considerable ability but he inherited some serious structural problems in his company, said J. Robin West, the chairman of Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting group to the energy industry based in Washington.
He said that Mobil's prime assets include the Arun natural gas field in Indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which has contributed up to one-third of Mobil's profits for years but is beginning to run down.
The field, in production since 1977, supplies liquefied natural gas to Japan and Korea.
Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly to cut costs and muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan, where it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field, the payoff from such ventures is many years away.
Other companies face similar strains.
The challenge is to replace their crown jewels and grow in an increasingly competitive environment, West said.
Noto has not been shy about sitting down with other companies such as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination made sense.
Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a much stronger and bigger company than Mobil, he has not been immune to the strains on the global petroleum business.
Those strains intensified this year when Russia's economic collapse raised the risks of Exxon's extensive exploration venture in that country.
Exxon has also been more of a follower than a leader in huge projects in the deep offshore fields, where major finds have been made near West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Times are tough in the oil patch.
Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing.
Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration.
Given the exotic locales of the most promising untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper.
And with West Texas crude trading at around$ 12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil won't be selling for$ 100 a barrel by the turn of the century something analysts were predicting during the oil price run-up of the early 1980s.
Philip Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business.
Following are excerpts from the conversation : Q.
There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon-Mobil deal.
Do you see any problems?
A.
Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal.
I think it is far from that.
But if it were to happen, I don't see many problems.
BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with.
Exxon-Mobil comes close.
The first issue is competition in local markets.
The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players there.
If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's positions on global warming.
Q.
Why are you skeptical about the deal?
A.
Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger.
They had talks with Amoco.
They wanted to buy Conoco.
But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this.
That could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place, and he has been a very strong leader.
Q. Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon.
Why do they need to get bigger?
A.
In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game : Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco.
Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal players.
Q.
That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.
A.
From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditures rose 8 percent.
Mobil's rose 14 percent.
But Mobil's expenditures were much more sensitive to the price elasticities of oil than Exxon's.
They were pushing the envelope, and when prices fell they had to cut back.
Exxon has tried to build a very large presence systematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices.
They are brutally efficient.
Q.
Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade.
Do you agree?
A.
You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil companies.
I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year.
It is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at$ 5 a barrel, depending on what happens to the world economy.
During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries.
That will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries.
And when the Asian economies start growing again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say$ 20 a barrel, in the next 18 months.
Q.
The number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years, regardless, isn't it?
A.
We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight.
There is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society.
Q.
Do you think oil stocks are a good investment?
A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 months.
And it is an area where investors need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies.
Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.
Those divestitures would further reshape an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the low price of oil.
But the mergers and other corporate combinations are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and Mobil.
Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said the boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to consider an agreement.
Shares of both surged on the New York Stock Exchange.
Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition in those areas is brisk.
But in retailing and marketing operations, an Exxon-Mobil combination would be like Ford merging with General Motors, Macy's with Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer in New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more than a decade ago.
In the United States, the deal would come under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton administration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor not seen since the 1970s.
The agency has blocked a number of proposed mergers, such as the$ 4 billion combination of Staples and Office Depot, the two largest office supply discounters, and two deals involving the four largest drug wholesalers.
On the other hand it has approved other big mergers, such as Boeing's$ 14 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas.
The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior official said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust before it was dismantled by the Supreme Court in 1911.
The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance, they will be able to get the competition of one another off their backs, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School of Law and an antitrust expert.
It may be that we are looking at a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation on the national level 100 years ago.
The Federal Trade Commission recently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing operations in Hawaii and California.
It is also considering the proposed$ 54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon and Mobil.
In the past, when there have been two mergers involving the same industry, the government has considered them together in deciding how to deal with them, said Terry Calvani, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron.
But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s.
It's a real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy analyst at Bear Stearns.
If the FTC let this one go through without major divesting, then everything would be fair game.
Why couldn't GM merge with Ford?
While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals.
Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case could be so large that they are deal-breakers.
Other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials.
These are not absolute obstacles, said John Hervey, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin& AMP; Jenrette.
In the past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states have almost always become involved in raising questions because of the high visibility of the local gas station.
When a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain to raise questions, Axinn said.
Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West Coast, where they also have big refining operations.
Because the two companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out.
The regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in those areas.
Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices.
Hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major American and European oil companies is only 17 percent.
They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered.
So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow.
I think it's a terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4 : 30 on Sunday morning.
He stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed.
It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company.
It's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work.
I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it.
Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore a Big E patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's.
The latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's generators.
But if the Mobil Corp. has to be sold, Lewis said, noting the gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large as the Exxon Corp. might be the least of all evils.
If we merged with Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added.
A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries, in petroleum as much as any.
Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they have already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned for the full year.
But the numbers that matter even more are the ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas stations the lowest prices, after inflation, since the Depression.
Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company.
Some people close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered by their boards until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday.
And that is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop.
No, he didn't know about that merger talk on television, said Herrington, who also works full-time producing lubricants.
He had asked some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier this month, about all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing.
Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the field.
One company's accountants could almost do the work for two.
But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people.
Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery.
Antitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice that Exxon has refineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical industry's home.
The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry set lining the Neches River off the Gulf, has become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher.
With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make$ 55,000 or$ 65,000 a year.
People go there to retire there, Herrington said, as he drove around the plant's fenced periphery.
Lewis, in his 17th year, is a third-generation employee.
But his nephew laboring here too is the exception.
The workers streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them.
The cutbacks have, so far, come through attrition, with retirements often encouraged by incentives.
But the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the best times are long gone.
His members chafe at the experts who come in from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's job.
In tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime( although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant has become safer over the years).
They complain about the growing numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks.
But with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement savings in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining.
Some share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency measures they agree are necessary for true job security.
Some take the attitude that every company is always for sale.
They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it, said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain.
But if they fork out$ 60 billion?
I'd look it over.
With most Mobil executives saying as little as possible for now, calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a peep.
Union leaders, however, are already squawking.
''I don't believe creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry, said Robert Wages, a former refinery operator himself and now the union's president, by telephone Saturday.
Nevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have to keep to its terms.
Many members, who typically came to work after high school, are already molding the oil companies latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious MBA's.
They're the biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring to Exxon.
He was coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station.
So they go buy the second biggest.
That's one way to get rid of the competition.
I just hope it's not something like the 80s buying companies and scrapping them.
Or something like the Robber Baron era a century before, said Mabry, another operator.
Didn't the teachers teach us all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back?
Remember that?
he said, looking to his friend, Lewis, the Big E, for agreement.
But I better shut up.
I still work for Mobil.
Used to, Lewis said.
