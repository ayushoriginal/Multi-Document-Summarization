Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. 
Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians? 
Netanyahu said. 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.
