In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1.
The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November.
The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
