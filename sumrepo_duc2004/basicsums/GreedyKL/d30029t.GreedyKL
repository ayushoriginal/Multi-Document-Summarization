Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.
Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds, set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996.
American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers( 22 miles) south of Gabo Island.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot( 12-meter) vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles( 100 kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.
